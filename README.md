# Office Drone

This is a console application which lets you control the behaviour of a drone via a command interface.

## Instructions

Navigate to the application folder in your terminal and run the Program.cs file. 

Follow the prompts and input commands to the drone. Commands need to be entered in a certain order for them to be executed. The correct type of arguments also need to be passed when a command requires extra information. Further instructions will be logged to the console.
